title: "Podcast: Luke speaks to Elixir Mix"
---

Luke Imhoff of the Lumen team recently joined the Elixir Mix hosts to talk about Lumen. He ended up sharing insights into the process of evolving WASM and making sure it doesn't end up exclusively suited to Object-Oriented Programming as well as covering a lot of what Lumen is, isn't and can be. It could have been titled "Sneaking Elixir into the enterprise"!

It is also a good chance to get familiar with the very interesting background of such a central figure in the development of Lumen. And you get to hear the editor of this very site (Lars) as part of his regular role as a host on Elixir Mix.

Give it a [listen right here](https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-113-lumen-with-luke-imhoff/) or in your favorite podcatcher.
