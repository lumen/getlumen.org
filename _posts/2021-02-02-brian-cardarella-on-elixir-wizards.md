title: Brian Cardarella visits the Elixir Wizards
---

Lumen's own Brian Cardarella joins the Elixir Wizards for [an episode on adopting Elixir](https://smartlogic.io/podcast/elixir-wizards/s5e9-cardarella/). If you want to understand the business case of Elixir or know about the path DockYard took through Rails & Ember to end up in Elixir land it covers that very well. It does also get into some of what Lumen is, can be and Brian's thoughts on what the project could be useful for and how far along we are. So open your podcatcher and give it a whirl.
